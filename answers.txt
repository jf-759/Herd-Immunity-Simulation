1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)

    - Population Size: 1000
    - Percent Vaccinated: 10%
    - Virus Name: "Sniffles"
    - Mortality Rate: 12%
    - Reproductive Rate: 5%
    - People Initially Infected: 10%

    `python3 simulation.py 1000 0.1 Sniffles 0.12 0.5 10`

2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

- 178.2%

3. What percentage of the population died from the virus?

- 90.1%

4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?

- 746,361


Notes for myself: 
I know some of the code on here doesn't add up mathematically. 
Hopefully I can figure that out one day, when I get better at coding. 
As for right now, I think this is the best that I can do.
